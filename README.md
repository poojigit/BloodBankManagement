🩸 Blood Bank Management System 🔥 (Flask + HTML + SQLite Project)
🚀 I’ve successfully built a Blood Bank Management System — a full-stack web-based application using Python (Flask) and HTML/CSS.
This project is designed to simulate a real-world blood bank where donors and admins can interact through a simple yet powerful UI hosted locally on localhost.

🧰 Tech Stack Used:
Frontend: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript

Backend: Python with Flask (Micro Web Framework)

Database: SQLite3

Templating Engine: Jinja2

Hosting: Localhost (Flask development server)

Tools: VS Code, Postman (optional), Python 3.13+

👥 User Roles:
Donor

Register/Login

Provide personal details (name, email, phone, WhatsApp)

Select blood group

View their own dashboard

Delete their account if desired

Admin

Login with admin role

View real-time blood stock grouped by blood group

View full list of registered donors

Clickable info: 📞 Phone → call, 📧 Email → Gmail, 💬 WhatsApp → WhatsApp Web

Delete any donor’s data

Personalized admin greeting (Welcome message)

🛠️ Features Implemented:
✅ Registration with Role-based Input
✅ Conditional Blood Group selection (only for Donors)
✅ Login + Session Handling
✅ User-specific Dashboards
✅ SQLite Database Integration
✅ Admin Controls & Data Monitoring
✅ Data Deletion (Admin + Donor both)
✅ Clickable Contact Links (tel:, mailto:, WhatsApp)
✅ Fully Styled Responsive Pages (CSS)

⚙️ Working:
The app runs on localhost:5000 and loads an elegant homepage with Register/Login buttons.

Role selection dynamically shows/hides blood group field (via JavaScript).

On login, role decides redirection to:

/admin for Admin

/donor for Donor

SQLite3 handles backend storage of users and blood data.

Admin dashboard aggregates donor info and presents it with action buttons.

💻 Output Preview:
Homepage: Clean welcome screen with CTA buttons

Donor Dashboard: Contact info + Logout + Delete account

Admin Dashboard: Personalized greeting + Blood stock count + Donor table with delete buttons and clickable contact options.

🔐 Security:
Session-based login protection

Form validations

Role-based redirection to prevent unauthorized access

📌 Learning Outcome:
✅ Flask routing, templates, and session
✅ CRUD operations with SQLite
✅ Dynamic HTML with conditional rendering
✅ JavaScript + Python communication
✅ Real-world logic like role separation & blood stock grouping
